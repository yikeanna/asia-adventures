        Hi! My name is Anna Zhang and I am a full-stack software engineer based in Montreal. I recently graduated in Computer Science major at McGill university in April 2023. After my finals, I decided to travel to Asia for 2 months.
         I visited 18 cities in 5 countries. I was amazed by the beauty of the cities I visited, hence why I decided to create this website to share my experience and my love for these cities. I hope you will enjoy it!
